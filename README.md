# youtube-tweaks 03 August 2021

Removes redundant parts of youtube HTML

Currently removes: comments, main page banner and category header, sign in and settings buttons, youtube apps button, microphone button and left sidebar.

Installation instructions:

1. Clone repository and extract if downloaded as a ZIP

2. On any chromium-based browser (tested on ungoogled-chromium 91.0.4472.77), enter "chrome://extensions" into the address bar

3. Turn on developer mode

4. Click "Load Unpacked" and select extracted repository directory.

5. Turn it on and enjoy

Will probably break if youtube changes its site (again), use at your own risk.
